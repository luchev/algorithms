### Karatrusba algorithm

#### Description

Fast multiplication algorithm for big real numbers. Reduce multiplications needed for big numbers, by adding more additions and subtractions.

#### Complexity

$O(N^{log_23}) \approx O(N^{1.58})$ where $N$ = number of digits of the numbers being multiplied
